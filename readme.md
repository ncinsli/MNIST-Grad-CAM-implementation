# MNIST classification NN & Grad-CAM interpretation implementation
This repository is my interview task for ISP RAS Information systems department.


## Task structure
1. Train a CNN with at least 80% precision.
1. Implement a [Grad-CAM approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07450).  
1. Test model on a random batch (at least 5 pictures): display source, heatmap, model prediction for the picture and its true value.
1. Compute Fidelity for every image in a batch, compute average fidelity and its dispersion.
